<p>Valley Skate, now Danger Valley, was established in 2004 by Ehren McGhehey (Danger Ehren) who got some teeth knocked out so that he could bring back the bacon to his home town McMinnville and stoke the skate scene. His home folk friends abide. We swelter in the wings come lust come fancy we abide.</p>
<p>Ehren McGhehey was born 1976 in the town of McMinnville, Oregon. Being raised in the community of McMinnville he made many ties with it’s people both young and old. There were skateboarders, artists, musicians, craftsman, clothing makers, brand builders, photographers, videographers and all manner of creative and ambitious youth, all who worked together to try many things.</p>

<p>From the year of 1993 until 1997 Ehren was on a committee to help build a local skate park in McMinnville. It was the first of many skate parks to be built in Yamhill county and a pioneer in all of Oregon skate parks. Following it’s completion there was a plan to expand and add on to the current park to make it a driving force in tourism and skateboarding for McMinnville and it’s local economy. Dreamland, the Burnside Portland park creators, were hired to bring this new addition to our McMinnville park. Present day we have Dreamland’s Newburg Park to the near north of us and their Linclon City Park at the coast. We are the middle stop between these two places.</p>
<p>He have been involved in the industries of Skate, Surf, and Snow for the past 15 years and have built a working relationship with many companies and athletes. I am currently involved in the entertainment industry and have many opportunities to market the shop and it’s brand.</p>
<p>My goal is to be the premiere Skate Shop in Yamhill County (McMinnville), by hosting events at local skate parks to help boost economy for retail shops and local community business. One of my goals is also to build &nbsp;and promote the Danger Valley brand throughout the world and to deliver good products.</p>

<h2>Past Life &amp; New Brand</h2>

<p>Formerly called Valley Skate Surf &amp; Snow, Danger Valley under it's new name is a continuation of that same company, just with a new name. The new name comes with a new brand -- The Danger Valley brand.</p>

<h2>Live Action Wheels</h2>

<p>Danger Valley has dusted off the <a href="http://vimeo.com/2221406">old skate team</a> and got those young geezers back in boards.&nbsp;</p>
