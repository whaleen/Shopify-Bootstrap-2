Shopify Template uses Twitter Bootstrap 2

Was created for the website dangervalley.com. Was not created as an out-of-the-box theme solution for Shopfiy designers, however, here it is if one wanted to give it a wirl. Be warned there are probably some hard-coded peices of code that pertain to the Danger Valley website.

Danger Valley is a brick and mortar skateboard, shoe, and clothing store. There are probably some useful peices of functionality contained within this theme, particularly a size filter for shoe, shirt, and board sizes, which by default with Shopify was hard to acheive. 

Anyway. That's all.
